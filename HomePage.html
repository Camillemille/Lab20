I climbed your arms
Then you pulled away
New cavity moved into
My heart today
The more she sings
The more it seems
That now I'm through

Now I'm through
With the new you
Now I'm through
With the new you
New... you

I drove you home 
Then you moved away
New cavity moved into
My heart today
The more I scream
The more it seems
Now I'm through

Now I'm through
With the new you
Now I'm through
With the new you
Now I'm through
With the new you
New... you
